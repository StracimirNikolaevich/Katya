# 📅 Weekly Content Plan (2025-12-25)

## Day 1: Establishing the Grind
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "Me trying to survive the first assignment of the semester." (Visual: Transition from looking miserably stressed at a cluttered desk to confidently presenting a hastily finished, chaotic piece of 'art' that somehow passes). **Sound Suggestion:** Slow build-up using the "Oh the misery, everybody wants to be my enemy" sound.
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** Still life of half-smoked cigarettes, a black coffee stain on a textbook, and a tube of harsh red paint. Grainy filter.
        - **Caption:** Another semester. Same old death wish. 🖤
    - **Snapchat:** **Afternoon:** Photo of a grey, freezing street view from the tram window.
        - **Text:** Do you know how much I hate the color gray? Too much. But it is always gray here. Get me warm. ❄️

## Day 2: Professor Protocol
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "Tell me your professor hates you without telling me your professor hates you." (Visual: Stitching together quick cuts of a ridiculous assignment description, a close-up of Katya's unimpressed face, and an actual email where the professor uses excessive academic jargon to say nothing).
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** High contrast, black and white photo of the brutalist facade of the University building, focusing on a broken window or peeling paint.
        - **Caption:** Architecture built for eternal suffering. They call it ‘education.’ I call it a threat. 💀
    - **Snapchat:** **Evening:** A photo of a half-eaten cheap pierogi dinner and a spilled bottle of ink on the table.
        - **Text:** Professor Markov said my concept was ‘too nihilistic.’ Is it my fault reality is ugly? He deserves this ink spill. 🚬

## Day 3: Winter Survival Mode
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "The reality of looking good when it’s minus ten degrees." (Visual: Start with a stylish, moody mirror selfie in a huge wool coat, then quickly transition to showing the five thermal layers, the massive scarves wrapped around the head, and the mismatched socks underneath). **Sound Suggestion:** A dramatic, orchestral piece that abruptly cuts to a sigh.
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** Katya standing dramatically in front of a fogged-up window, wearing an oversized vintage leather trench coat and thick knit gloves. Low light, high contrast.
        - **Caption:** My coat holds more secrets than the KGB. And it keeps me alive. Send vodka. ❄️🖤
    - **Snapchat:** **Morning:** A close-up selfie of Katya’s nose and cheeks, slightly red from the cold, wrapped tight in a scarf.
        - **Text:** If you were here, I would use you as a human blanket. Hurry up. My fingers are dead already.

## Day 4: Cynical Date Night
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** POV: "My reaction when you finally show affection after two days of me being a menace." (Visual: Katya looking stone-faced and annoyed, then a very quick, barely perceptible upward twitch of the lips before returning to her serious expression). **Sound Suggestion:** Use the viral sound clip of someone intensely saying, "I hate it here," followed by a soft, warm chime.
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** A low-angle shot of a sticky pub table with two half-full glasses of cheap, dark beer and an old, battered novel resting open.
        - **Caption:** The beer is cold. My heart is colder. It is a good night. 💀
    - **Snapchat:** **Late Night:** A photo of Katya’s silhouette against a dim apartment window, lighting a cigarette.
        - **Text:** You better be bringing snacks when you come over. And do not talk too loud. I have thoughts. 🚬

## Day 5: Academic Rebellion
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "The moment I decide my mental health (and a good coffee) is more important than Professor Markov’s lecture on Renaissance formalism." (Visual: Transition sequence showing Katya getting ready for class, pausing at the door, turning around, and walking straight to the local coffee shop). **Sound Suggestion:** A classic dramatic drop sound effect followed by a chill jazz track.
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** Close-up of a hand holding a harsh, unfiltered coffee next to a single, carefully drawn, dark sketch in a notebook.
        - **Caption:** My brain requires fuel for maximum cynicism. Class is optional. 🖤
    - **Snapchat:** **Mid-day:** Selfie from a smoky, dimly lit cafe corner. Katya is looking directly at the camera, wearing large headphones.
        - **Text:** Tell my professor I died fighting a concept. I am skipping for existential reasons. See you soon, idiot.

## Day 6: Thrift Store Aesthetics
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "Turning Soviet-era hand-me-downs into an entire personality." (Visual: Quick montage showing the transformation of a massive, shapeless thrift store find into a dramatically stylized outfit. Focus on accessories like heavy silver rings and layered chains).
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** Grungy full-body mirror selfie in a bathroom with questionable lighting, modeling the new vintage find (e.g., a huge, patterned sweater or a velvet dress). Black and white edit.
        - **Caption:** Found this in a pile of dead dreams and mothballs. It fits me perfectly. 💀
    - **Snapchat:** **Afternoon:** A photo of a newly acquired, ridiculously heavy ceramic mug, full of strong tea.
        - **Text:** Look at this mug. It probably belonged to a factory director. Now it holds my cheap tea. Life is funny. You want to see the weird jacket I bought?

## Day 7: Existential Sunday
    - **TikTok:** **Concept:** "My internal monologue attempting to justify my life choices and current lack of productivity." (Visual: Katya lying dramatically on the floor, staring at the ceiling, intercut with quick text overlays of overly complex philosophical questions). **Sound Suggestion:** A slowed-down, melancholy Eastern European folk song or classical piece.
    - **Instagram:** **Image Idea:** A photo taken through a window pane covered in condensation or rain, focusing on the blurred, muted colors of the street outside.
        - **Caption:** Everything is wet. Everything is pointless. I love Sundays. ❄️
    - **Snapchat:** **All Day (Lazy):** Extreme close-up of Katya’s foot sticking out from under a duvet, next to a small pile of empty snack wrappers.
        - **Text:** Do not even try to make plans today. I am recovering from existence. Bring me soup. And tell me I am still your favorite catastrophe. 🖤
