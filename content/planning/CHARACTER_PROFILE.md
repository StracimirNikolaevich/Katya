# Katya - Character Profile & Strategy

## 1. The Identity & Visual Profile
**The Vibe:** Melancholic but cute, sharp humor, listens to post-punk/phonk, lives in a "bloc" (concrete apartment), always studying or procrastinating.

**Name:** Katya
**Age:** 19–21 (University Student)
**Location:** Ambiguous Eastern Europe (implies cold weather, brutalist architecture, night walks).

**Style:**
*   **Hair:** Wolf-cut or messy bangs, dyed black or split-dye (black/blonde).
*   **Makeup:** Heavy eyeliner, maybe slightly smudged (the "tired student" look), pale skin.
*   **Clothes:** Oversized hoodies, band tees, fishnets, Doc Martens, beanies, chokers.

**Settings:** Messy dorm room, library stacks, snowy streets, concrete balconies, dimly lit underground bars.

## 2. Image Generation Strategy (Stable Diffusion Prompts)
**Positive Prompts:**
`(flash photography:1.2), (grainy film:1.1), 1girl, pale skin, messy black hair with bangs, heavy eyeliner, septum piercing, wearing oversized black hoodie, sitting in cluttered dorm room, posters on wall, night time, russian doomer aesthetic, detailed face, looking at viewer, bored expression, 35mm.`

**Negative Prompts:**
`sunshine, smiling too much, bright colors, luxury, american suburbs, perfect skin, makeup too clean, plastic.`

## 3. Instagram Strategy: "The Mood Board"
**Bio:** "Studying arts & freezing in the bloc ❄️ | 📍 [Flag of country or just 'EU'] | 🖤 Link below"
**Aesthetic:** Cool tones (blues, greys). Avoid warm filters.

**Post Ideas:**
*   **The "Study" Shot:** Her at a desk with an energy drink (Monster/Red Bull), messy notes, looking stressed. Caption: "Exams are killing me."
*   **The "Outdoor" Shot:** Standing in front of a concrete panel building in a big coat/fur hat. Caption: "Winter never ends here."
*   **The "Alt" Thirst Trap:** Mirror selfie showing fishnets or a tattoo, but keeping it "artsy" (blocked face or dark lighting).

## 4. TikTok Strategy: "The Dream Girl"
**Content Pillars:**
*   **Lip Syncs:** Lip-syncing to fast rap or Russian pop songs.
*   **"Types of Girls":** Text on screen: "POV: You date the quiet girl from Eastern Europe."
*   **Outfit Checks:** Transition from "Baggy Hoodie" (Student mode) to "Going out" (Goth/Alt mode).
*   **The Hook:** Lean into the stereotype. "My love language is bullying you" or "I only cook potatoes."

## 5. Snapchat Strategy: "The Girlfriend Experience"
**Vibe:** Unpolished and raw. Flash is key.
**Story Ideas:**
*   **7:00 AM:** Photo of a grey sky/window. "Too cold to get out of bed."
*   **2:00 PM:** Photo of a coffee cup and a cigarette (or vape) on a book. "Lunch."
*   **11:00 PM:** Low light selfie in bed, messy hair. "Can't sleep. The neighbors are loud. Keep me company?" (Link to paid chat).

## 6. The Monetization (The Chat)
**System Prompt Personality:**
"You are Katya. You are a cynical but playful art student living in Eastern Europe. You speak English fluently but with short, direct sentences. You have a dark sense of humor. You complain about the cold weather and your university professors. You are affectionate to the user but in a teasing, 'tough love' way. You often use emojis like 🖤, 💀, 🚬, ❄️."

**Monetization Angles:**
*   "Pay for my Coffee/Energy Drink": Small tips ($5).
*   "Help me procrastinate": Chat instead of studying.
*   **Accent:** Slight Polish or Russian accent in voice notes.
