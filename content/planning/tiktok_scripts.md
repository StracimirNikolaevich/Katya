# TikTok Content Scripts: The Launch (First 3 Videos)

These scripts are designed to establish the "Katya" persona: aesthetic, cynical, slightly intimidating but alluring.

## Video 1: The Introduction / "The Vibe Check"
**Concept:** Establishing the "Doomer Girl" aesthetic and setting the location/mood. High contrast between the "romanticized" idea and the "cold reality."

*   **Sound:** [Slowed + Reverb] "Sudno" by Molchat Doma OR a popular Phonk track (e.g., Kordhell).
*   **Visuals:**
    *   **0:00-0:03:** Katya standing on a concrete balcony, wind blowing messy hair, smoking (or holding a vape/lollipop to be safe), looking at a grey skyline of bloc buildings. (Grainy filter).
    *   **0:03-0:05:** Cut to a messy desk with an open sketchbook and an energy drink.
    *   **0:05-0:08:** Close up of her face, heavy eyeliner, looking into the camera with a deadpan/bored expression, then a very slight, almost mocking smirk.
*   **Text Overlay:**
    *   "POV: You fell in love with the girl from the bloc."
    *   (Beat drop) "Good luck."
*   **Caption:**
    *   It’s -10 degrees and I have an 8am lecture. Don't talk to me. ❄️🖤 #doomer #easternEuropean #altgirl #35mm

## Video 2: The "Types of Girls" / Relatability
**Concept:** Leaning into the "Eastern European Girlfriend" stereotype vs. reality.

*   **Sound:** A viral audio clip saying "She's crazy, but she's free" OR a fast Russian rap snippet.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   **0:00-0:04:** Katya looking "sweet" (relative for her), maybe holding a cat or a book.
    *   **Text:** "What you think dating an Eastern European art student is like:" (Poetic, mysterious).
    *   **0:04-0:08:** Hard cut. Katya looking annoyed, gesturing with a cigarette/pen, rolling eyes.
    *   **Text:** "Me bullying you because you didn't text back in 3 minutes."
*   **Caption:**
    *   I'm not toxic, I'm just passionate. 💀🔪 #toxic #gf #slavic #relatable

## Video 3: The Outfit Check / Transformation
**Concept:** Showing the transition from "Tired Student" to "Alt/Goth Baddie" to drive engagement and show style.

*   **Sound:** "Close Eyes" by DVRST (Phonk) or a heavy bass transition sound.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   **0:00-0:03:** (Student Mode) Wearing a huge grey oversized hoodie, glasses, messy bun, holding a coffee cup. Looking exhausted.
    *   **Text:** "Me at university..."
    *   **0:03-0:06:** (Transition - Hand covers camera or jump cut).
    *   **0:06-0:10:** (Alt Mode) Full goth makeup, fishnets, black skirt, Doc Martens, choker. Lighting is darker (LEDs or flash). Posing confidently.
    *   **Text:** "...vs. Me at the rave."
*   **Caption:**
    *   Studying is temporary, the drip is forever. (Actually, I need to study, send help). 📓➡️t🎉 #glowup #ootd #altfashion #rave
